<h1 id="in"> BRIEF INTRO: </h1> 
<p> <dd id="intro1">Dinosaur means terrible lizard.
    The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, 
    with the name "dinosaur" having been coined by Sir Richard Owen 
    in 1841 to refer to these "great fossil lizards". <br>
    Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic Era, especially the Jurassic 
    and Cretaceous periods. They have always been recognized as an extremely varied group of animals; 
    over 900 non-avian dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty as of 2018, and the total 
    number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around 1850, nearly 75% of 
    which remain to be discovered, and 1124 species by 2016. A 1995 study predicted that about 
    3,400 dinosaur genera ever existed, including many that would not have been preserved in the 
    fossil record. In 2016, the estimated number of dinosaur species that existed in the Mesozoic was 
    1,543–2,468. In 2021, the number of modern-day birds (avian dinosaurs) was estimated to be at 
    10,806 species.[rst appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, 
    although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active 
    research. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction 
    event 201.3 million years ago; their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous 
    periods. The fossil record shows that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from 
    earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the 
    <a href="#cp" id="cpe" style="color: slategray;">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction</a> event 
    approximately 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or 
    birds; and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds.<br>
    <b>Birds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs.</b> In 
    traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, 
    a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with 
    dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this 
    approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must 
    be included in the group as well. <b>Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, 
    therefore, not extinct.</b> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which 
    are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.</dd></p>
