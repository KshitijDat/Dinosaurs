<h1> BRIEF INTRO: </h1> 
<p> <dd id="intro1">Dinosaur means terrible lizard.
    The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, 
    with the name "dinosaur" having been coined by Sir Richard Owen 
    in 1841 to refer to these "great fossil lizards". They first appeared during the 
    Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and 
    timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research. They became the 
    dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million 
    years ago; their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The fossil 
    record shows that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods 
    during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the 
    <a href="#cp" id="cpe" style="color: slategray;">Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction</a> event approximately 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can 
    therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, 
    which are all dinosaurs other than birds.<br>
    <b>Birds are now recognized as being the sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs.</b> In 
    traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, 
    a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with 
    dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this 
    approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants of members of the group must 
    be included in the group as well. <b>Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, 
    therefore, not extinct.</b> Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which 
    are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.</dd></p>
